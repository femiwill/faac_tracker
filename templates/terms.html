                        The Federation Account receives income from oil and gas revenue, company income tax, customs and excise duties, and other federally-collected revenues. Every month, FAAC meets to decide how much each tier of government receives based on a constitutionally defined formula.

                        Additionally, oil-producing states receive a special <strong>13% derivation</strong> from natural resources produced in their territory, which is why states like Rivers, Delta, Akwa Ibom, and Bayelsa typically receive much higher allocations.

                        This is each state or LGA's share of the <strong>Value Added Tax (VAT)</strong> pool. VAT is a consumption tax (currently 7.5%) collected by the <strong>Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS)</strong> on goods and services across Nigeria.
                    </p>
                    <p>The VAT pool is first split among the three tiers of government:</p>

                        The 20% derivation factor is why <strong>Lagos</strong> receives significantly more VAT allocation than other states — the bulk of Nigeria's commercial activity and VAT collection happens there. This has been a subject of ongoing debate, with some states advocating for a higher derivation component.

                        The gross figure represents the total amount a state is entitled to receive from the Federation Account in a given month, before obligations like loan repayments are subtracted.

                    <p>
                        Deductions are amounts subtracted from the gross allocation <strong>at source</strong> before the money reaches the state. These typically include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>External debt service</strong> — repayments on foreign loans taken by the state</li>
                        <li><strong>Domestic debt service</strong> — repayments on bonds, treasury bills, and local loans</li>
                        <li><strong>Contractual obligations</strong> — payments for federally-guaranteed contracts</li>
                        <li><strong>Pension contributions</strong> — contributions to pension schemes</li>
                        <li><strong>National water/power obligations</strong> — dues owed to federal utilities</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-muted small mb-0">
                        Deductions typically range from <strong>8% to 15%</strong> of the gross allocation, but can be higher for states with significant debt obligations. This is often a point of concern, as some states lose a large portion of their allocation to debt servicing.

                        The net allocation is the <strong>actual amount</strong> a state receives after all deductions have been made. This is the money that hits the state's account and is available for spending on governance, infrastructure, salaries, and public services.

                    <p>
                        IGR refers to revenue that a <strong>state generates on its own</strong>, independent of federal allocations. It is a measure of a state's fiscal self-sufficiency and economic activity.
                    </p>
                    <p>Common sources of IGR include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Personal income tax (PAYE)</strong> — the largest source for most states</li>
                        <li><strong>Land use charges &amp; property taxes</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Business premises registration</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Road taxes &amp; vehicle licensing</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Market levies &amp; fees</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Fines, licenses, and permits</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Investment income</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Lagos State leads dramatically in IGR (over ₦780B in 2024), generating more internally than it receives from FAAC. Most other states are heavily dependent on federal allocations, with IGR making up a small fraction of their total revenue.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted small mb-0">
                        Improving IGR is considered critical for Nigeria's fiscal federalism — the more states can fund themselves, the less dependent they are on oil revenue and federal transfers.

                        LGAs are the third tier of government in Nigeria, below the federal and state levels. Nigeria has <strong>774 LGAs</strong> across its 36 states and FCT.

                    <p>
                        Each LGA receives its own FAAC allocation directly from the Federation Account (not through the state government). However, in practice, many state governments control or influence how LGA funds are spent through <strong>State-Local Government Joint Account Allocation Committees (JACs)</strong>.

                    <p class="mb-0 text-muted small">
                        LGA allocations are distributed using a similar formula to states (equality, population, land mass, etc.), but at smaller amounts. The capital city LGA of each state typically receives a slightly larger share due to higher population density and administrative responsibilities.

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The Nigerian Constitution mandates that <strong>13% of revenue derived from natural resources</strong> (primarily crude oil and gas) must be returned to the states where those resources are produced. This is known as the derivation principle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This primarily benefits the oil-producing states in the <strong>South South</strong> zone — Rivers, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Edo, and Cross River — as well as Ondo and Imo states which also produce oil.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-0 text-muted small">
                        The 13% derivation is a major reason why oil-producing states receive significantly higher FAAC allocations than non-oil-producing states. There have been ongoing debates about increasing this percentage, with some advocates pushing for up to 50% derivation.
